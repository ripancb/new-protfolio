                <p>
                    Based on the process of web development, a web developer is a programmer that creates web-based
                    applications to be accessed through the Internet. These websites and apps have specific features and
                    functions that the dev is responsible to build through his programming skills.

            <div id="front-end" class="experience-item">
                <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
                <h3 class="orange-color">2010-Present | Front End Developer</h3>
                <p>
                    Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML,
                    CSS
                    and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them
                    directly.
                    The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create
                    the
                    front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how
                    the
                    field is developing.
